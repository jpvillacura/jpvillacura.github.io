  This article shows an implementation of quantum cryptography. We introduce the reader to the basic concepts of quantum computing so that they can easily understand the terms mentioned in the implementation related to cybersecurity and quantum key distribution (QKD). We show an application of QKD, where we can see how a spy is easily detected when a message is intercepted.
