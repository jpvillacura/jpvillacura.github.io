  <h2>Research Stay at Queen's University</h2>
  <hr />

  <p>
    I am currently undertaking a six-month research stay at the
    <strong>Queen’s Reliable Software Technology (QRST) Group</strong> at
    Queen’s University, funded by the
    <strong>Emerging Leaders in the Americas Program (ELAP)</strong>
    awarded by Global Affairs Canada.

    My work focuses on blockchain and distributed systems research,
    including rational mining models, smart contracts, and
    system-level security considerations.
