  <h2>Research Stay at Queen's University</h2>

  <p>
    I am currently undertaking a six-month research stay at the
    <strong>Queen’s Reliable Software Technology (QRST) Group</strong> at
    Queen’s University, funded by the
    <strong>Emerging Leaders in the Americas Program (ELAP)</strong>
    awarded by Global Affairs Canada.

    My research focuses on blockchain technologies. I am working on developing a framework for rational mining in proof-of-work blockchain networks. 
    Kingston is a beautiful city and I like the vibe of students here.  #GoGAELS
